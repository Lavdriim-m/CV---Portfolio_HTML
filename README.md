# Lavdrim Mustafi Portfolio/CV

This is my fisrt Portfolio/CV created using only HTML5 and CSS3 as a part of Homework for Bootcamp 10 at PERPROGRAMERA.com. The Webpage features a Header Section with some general information and ways to contact me, followed by two videos on the right side for you to watch on my YouTube Channel.

As you scroll down you will be able to read more about me and what I do in the "About Me" Section.

The third section called "Languages" shows you my speaking abilities in the languages I know, followed by links to my Social Media Platforms, embedded inside their corresponding logos.

The second-to-last Section called "Skills" showcases some of my skills and my proficiency at them, with an "iframe" on the right side where you can scroll and look at my Fiverr profile and read my reviews!

The last Section was left for my general working Experience and some Personal Projects attached for people to watch!
